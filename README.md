> Digital Investigator don't have to try and read people's mind anymore because people's interests, secrets, financial information, and even their love life are all on their computer.

The skills will be:
 - Conduct a complete DF (Digital Forensic) Analysis.
 - Reconstruct data structures and events from mass of information available
 - Able to locate artifacts, which are used as compelling evidence.

## Terms
 - *Evidence*: artifacts and secrets
 - *Digital Forensic*: is a discipline of forensic science, the recovery and investigation of artifacts found in digital devices, often in relation to a computer crime.

- Conventional crimes can involve digital investigations as: 
  1. Child exploitation
  2. Fraud
  3. Drug trafficking
  4 Terrorism
  5. Homicide


## Fundamentals
 The fundamental most include:
- Digital evidence
- Digital Forensic Tools
- Scientific methods

 ### Digital Evidence
Is defined as any digital information that is stored, transmitted or produced from electronic devices and software. Examples of digital evidence are:
 * Pictures produced by cameras of phones
 * Print logs saved on printers
 * Temporary Files produced by a web browsers
 * Downloaded files
 * email messages
 * deleted files

We should always carefully collect evidence, with digital media it is more critical.
if any procedure was conducted incorrectly, then the evidence might become inadmissible in court or affect jurors' decision.

 ### Digital Forensic Tools
Tools are important but Digital Forensic isn't about using tools, An Investigator is expected to have a deep understanding for the underlying technology he/she is dealing with.

There are three types of DF tools availoble for use
 * Proprietary
 * Open Source
 * Your Own

 ### Scientific Method
 Investigator have to:
 * Apply the Scientific Method during the investigation
 * Analyze data and compare samples
 * Notice any abbreviation, abnormalities and characteristics

_The Scientific Method is a body of techniques for_
 * Investigating a phenomena
 * Acquiring new knowledge, or
 * Correcting and integrating previous knowledge

**The methodology is simple**

The next steps are:
 - Make predictions based on the hypothesis
 - Consider alternative hypothesis 
 - Proving or disapproving is done through colleting specific data which supports the prediction.
